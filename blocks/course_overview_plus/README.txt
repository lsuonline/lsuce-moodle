Installation
------------

1. Place the course_overview_plus folder in the blocks folder and check permissions to make sure your webserver can read the files.

To replace the standard course_overview block
---------------------------------------------

1. Select 'customise this page' in My Moodle and delete the Course Overview block.
2. Add the Course Overview Plus block.
3. This is unlikely to appear in the correct place, move the block to the second slot down in the main column.

Problems?
--------

You can email me at a.james@yorksj.ac.uk

I am also able to extend the block to allow filtering of the course list (http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=184870&parent=805019) 
or provide help for developers who wish to do this.
