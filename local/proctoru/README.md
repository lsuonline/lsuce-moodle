# block_proctoru

Provides a library of functions oriented towards establishing ProctorU registration status for users.
Creates a custom profile field in `user_info_field` which stores a status code corresponding to an enumeration 
of possible statuses (defined as class constants in `lib.php`). Relies on an included set of classes for 
communicating with the ProctorU webservice.  
__NB__ the library currently relies on some LSU-specific lookups. Roadmap 
includes decoupling `Webservicelib.php` and making the local user lookup process optional or configurable.
Runs at cron.

## implements Sentinel
`local_proctoru` and 'block_sentinel` were originally one and the same codebase. In order to better 
separate disparate concerns, they have become independent of each other. `local_proctoru` implements
the `Sentinel` interface and can be used as one of `block_sentinel`'s client classes; to add this
module to `block_sentinel`, include `local_proctoru` in its `clients` admin settings list.

##Installation
Installation is the same for this as for any Moodle local plugin. Add to you `<SiteRoot>/local` directory
and navigate to the _Notifications_ page.

##Configuration
Admin settings determine whether the module processes users during cron, define roles to consider 
`ProctorU::EXEMPT` and all of the connection details required for communication with the various webservices.
