<!--The LMS coursework file contains data from the LMS system tracking each student’s progress with
assigned tasks over the term of a course. A separate data record exists for each
section/student/coursework item combination in the LMS. For each coursework item, It includes the id
and name of the item, due date and submitted date, the number of points possible and points received,
and the grade category and category weight.
This data feed should include the coursework for all active students recruited by Academic Partnerships
for the previous, current, and upcoming terms.-->
