### This plugin is stupid and should not be used by anyone. LSU provides NO warranty or liability if you choose to use this in any way.

1. Utilizes a mapping file provided by Panopto with the kaltura resource id and tha panopto video id.
1. Creates a new in-course Panopto link directly below the kaltura video resource.
1. Gives the administrator the ability to hide converted kaltura video resources.
1. Rewrites embedded HTML iframes and kaltura atto embeds to Panopto iframes if allowed. If not allowed, a Panopto link will be created.

Install by dropping into the 'local' folder in Moodle and renaming the folder to kalpanmaps.
