-- IMPORTANT NOTE FOR OOHOO DEVELOPERS -- 
-----------------------------------------
-- Part 1 --
* Don't skip this. It describes the process of changing the way departments work.
* Which will likely be the first change they have you doing. You could make yourself look
* super awesome by getting it done in 15 minutes. 

This plugin was written for U of L so departments are determined by course name 
rather than moodle category. It has however been designed so that this can easily
be changed. There are 3 functions in locallib that handle everything related to 
departments.

//Returns a list of all department names and a unique key to identify each one. (That key could be the category id.)
function get_departments(); 

//Checks if a user is a department administrator. The $dept var would be the unique key assigned to the department.
//You will not likely need to make changes to this function unless you decide to use permissions instead of the 
//admin page. (Permissions wouldn't have worked for U of L)
function is_dept_admin($dept, $USER); 

//Checks if a course is in a department. The $dept var would be the unique key assigned to the department.
//Right now it just makes sure the course title matches a specific format. It could be easily changed to
//test if a course falls in a category with the given id. ($dept)
function is_in_department($dept, $course); 

If you decide to make any changes create a branch in git so that the U of L version of this
stays intact. 

* Your welcome. A thank you gift is not necessary but would not be turned down.
* tl;dr: ... I said it was important. Go read it.

---------------- NOTES ----------------
---------------------------------------
 * Useful information but not super important. You could skip if you want to but
 * I wouldn't.

 - When I refer to global admins I refer to people with the admin capability for
    this plugin. These people have the capability to make users department
    administrators which will have the ability to make changes to evaluations
    within their departments.

-------------------------------------------
---------------- OLD NOTES ----------------
-------------------------------------------
* Allowed to skip these, but they may be useful.

Things to note & understand:
-Some functionality relies on the fact that students are within the students role, and not a custom role
-There is an admin capability that needs to be assigned to non-site admin that will need to be [global] admins for the evaluations.
-smtp needs to be setup, along with cron service to have reminders sent, and other functionality
-Question types can be added, but please note the required elements that are needed (look at question_comment for the most basic setup required, and question_5_rate for a more complicated example)

-tcpdf library is used for dynamic pdfs, and may take time to create (not cache or stored)
-server SUPPORT EMAIL is contained in the emails sent by moodle
-Theres a moodle bug where when an error is returned to a form - it doesn't want to load the data into date selectors without errors...(The data is sent to set_data function but nothing happens
    -A hidden field has been added to fix the issue
    -seems to only occur in the limited version of the eval_form
