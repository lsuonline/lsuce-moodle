$string['trustedhostsexplain'] = '<p>The trusted hosts mechanism allows specific machines to execute calls via XML-RPC to any part of the Moodle API. This is available for scripts to control Moodle behavior and can be a very dangerous option to enable. If in doubt, keep it off.</p> <p><strong>This is not needed for any standard MNet feature!</strong> Turn it on only if you know what you are doing.</p> <p>To enable it, enter a list of IP addresses or networks, one on each line. Some examples:</p> Your local host:<br />127.0.0.1<br />Your local host (with a network block):<br />127.0.0.1/32<br />Only the host with IP address 192.168.0.7:<br />192.168.0.7/32<br />Any host with an IP address between 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.255:<br />192.168.0.0/24<br />Any host whatsoever:<br />192.168.0.0/0<br />Obviously the last example is <strong>not</strong> a recommended configuration.';
