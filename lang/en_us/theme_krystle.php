<p>Krystle has been created to combine my favorite elements of several themes into a single location:
<ol>
<li>Responsive layouts from Danny Wahls Zebra theme</li>
<li>AwesomeBar menu from krystle by Lei Zhang/Paul Nicholls</li>
<li>Profile block from Aardvark by Shaun Daubney - and with additional work from Mary Evans</li>
<li>An alternative icon set based on the Fugue icons set by Yusuke Kamiyamane (Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license)</li>
<li>A box-slider I have used previously in work done with Mary Evans - Originally from EduMoodle by Dan Humpherson</li>
</ol>
<br />Credit for these developments goes to these individuals - credit for any errors I keep to myself :)</p>';
