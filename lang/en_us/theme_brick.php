You can change the theme color scheme via the theme settings page.</p> <h2>Tweaks</h2> <p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new theme that uses this theme, Base, and Canvas all as parents. This will ensure updates to any of those themes in the core will find their way into your new theme.</p> <h2>Credits</h2> <p>This theme was coded and is maintained by John Stabinger of NewSchool Learning. He can be contacted by email at contact@newschoollearning.com. </p> <h2>License</h2> <p>This, and all other themes included in the Moodle core, are licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.</p> </div> </div>';
