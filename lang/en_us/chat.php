$string['usingchat_help'] = 'The chat module contains some features to make chatting a little nicer.

* Smilies - Any smiley faces (emoticons) that you can type elsewhere in Moodle can also be typed here, for example :-)
* Links - Website addresses will be turned into links automatically
* Emoting - You can start a line with "/me" or ":" to emote, for example if your name is Kim and you type ":laughs!" or "/me laughs!" then everyone will see "Kim laughs!"
* Beeps - You can send a sound to other participants by clicking the "beep" link next to their name. A useful shortcut to beep all the people in the chat at once is to type "beep all".
* HTML - If you know some HTML code, you can use it in your text to do things like insert images, play sounds or create different colored text';
