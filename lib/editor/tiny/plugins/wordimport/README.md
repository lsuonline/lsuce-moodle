# moodle-tiny_wordimport
This plugin allows for importing Microsoft Word Files (.docx) to Moodle within the new TinyMCE editor.

## Requirements

## Installation

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins.

## Usage
Either use the Insert Word button in the TinyMCE editor and select a `.docx` Word file from the file picker, or drag and drop a `.docx` file into the editor.
Note that `.doc` files are currently not supported.

## Settings
By default, all editing teachers have the capability `tiny/wordimport:add` to import Word files in the TinyMCE editor, either via the import button or via drag-and-drop.
